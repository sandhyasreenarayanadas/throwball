<h2> What is throwball</h2>
<p>‘Throwball’ is a game that could be played indoors or outdoor with 2 teams which consists of 7 players in each. The game shares its roots with volleyball and whilst, on the surface, it may look similar but there are some fundamental differences. Like volleyball, it is played on a court that is split into two with a net in the middle but the playing surface of the court is much larger than a regular volleyball court. The governing body of this game is the International Throwball Federation (ITF)</p>

Players in Throwball attempt to defeat their opponents by throwing the ball into the opposition half, hoping that the other team will fail to return it, scoring them a point.As a team game, players have to work in unison together and must have a good understanding of each other's game as well as having clear channels of communication. This ensures that there are no confusions over who is going for the ball, potentially giving their opposition a point</p>
